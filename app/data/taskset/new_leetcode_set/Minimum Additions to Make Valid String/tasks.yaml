/t # Minimum Additions to Make Valid String
description:  
/t Given a string `word` to which you can insert letters "a", "b" or "c" anywhere and any number of times, return *the minimum number of letters that must be inserted so that `word` becomes **valid**.*

A string is called **valid** if it can be formed by concatenating the string "abc" several times.

 

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** word = "b"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Insert the letter "a" right before "b", and the letter "c" right next to "a" to obtain the valid string "**a**b**c**".
```
**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** word = "aaa"
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Insert letters "b" and "c" next to each "a" to obtain the valid string "a**bc**a**bc**a**bc**".
```
**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** word = "abc"
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** word is already valid. No modifications are needed. 
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= word.length <= 50`
* `word` consists of letters "a", "b" and "c" only.
